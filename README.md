Overview - 

For this project, I merged two csv files containing data relative to a pharmaceutical study using 249 mice and several drug regimens for squamous cell carcinoma(SCC), a commonly occuring form of skin cancer. The purpose of the analysis was to compare a target regimen (Capomulin) against alternative regimens to determine the affects these regimens had on tumor growth. Several tables and figures were also developed to show how each regimen compared.
